  {:question "Write a rule `[sequels ?m1 ?m2]` where `?m1` and `?m2` are movie entities. You'll need to use the attribute `:movie/sequel`. To implement this rule correctly you can think of the problem like this: A movie `?m2` is a sequel of `?m1` if either 
* `?m2` is the \"direct\" sequel of `m1` **or** 
* `?m2` is the sequel of some movie `?m` **and** that movie `?m` is the sequel to `?m1`.

There are (at least) three different ways to write the above query. Try to find all three solutions."
