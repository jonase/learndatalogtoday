# Learn Datalog Today

**Learn Datalog Today** is an interactive tutorial designed to teach you the [Datomic](https://datomic.com) dialect of [Datalog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datalog). Datalog is a declarative **database query language** with roots in logic programming. Datalog has similar expressive power as [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sql).

Datomic is a database with an interesting and novel architecture, giving its users a unique set of features. You can read more about Datomic at [https://datomic.com](http://datomic.com) and the architecture is described in some detail [in this InfoQ article](https://www.infoq.com/articles/Architecture-Datomic).
